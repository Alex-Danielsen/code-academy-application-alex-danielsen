    "\n",
    "•\t**Linked Lists** – A linked list is set of data in which each item points to another item (or the next item in the list). This excludes the last item, which points to a terminator. The benefit to this, is that items can be easily added or removed in the list without moving the physical memory location of the entire list. This means the add and remove operations happen in the same amount of time, regardless of the length of the list. However, searching through the list can require searching of the entire list.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t**Stacks** – Last in, first out is the guiding principle of stacks. If you think of the data as a tower, items are added on top of the existing items in the stack. Items cannot be taken off the stack again until the more recent items are removed. The most recently added item on the stack is the one that is ready to be removed. The first item added to the stack cannot be taken out again until all the items above it are removed. Searching, inserting and removing in a stack might go through each element before finishing, so the speed of these functions is proportional to the size of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t**Hash Maps** – A mapping of key-value pairs. Hash maps use a function, called a hash function, to map the values to their keys. This function allows searching through the data in a constant amount of time relative to the size (number of key-value pairs) in the map. The data is unordered and useful for databases, where large amounts of data need to be accessed, inserted and removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t**Trees** – A tree structures data into parents and children. Each item of data, also called a node, must have one parent node (except for the root of the tree, which is parentless), and 1 or more child nodes. These data structures have many well-defined search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*), with a range of pros and cons depending on the data itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\t**Heaps** – A heap is a somewhat ordered form of a tree. It ensures that the value of each parent node is always greater than or equal to or less than or equal to, the value of the child nodes. This ordering allows searching algorithms to be implemented quicker, but if the data is not pre-sorted, there is a tradeoff in the amount of time used to sort the data.\n"
